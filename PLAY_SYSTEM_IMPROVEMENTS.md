# Avatar Play System Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the `/play` system and trivia leaderboards in the Avatar Realms Collide Discord Bot.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Excessive Emoji Usage
**Problem**: The `/play` system was overloaded with emojis, making it look childish and unprofessional.

**Solution**: Systematically removed excessive emojis while maintaining essential visual hierarchy:
- Changed "ðŸŽ® Avatar Trivia Arena - Discord Components v2" â†’ "Avatar Trivia Arena"
- Removed emoji prefixes from field names (e.g., "ðŸ‘¤ Player Profile" â†’ "Player Profile")
- Cleaned up option displays (removed ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡© and decorative shapes)
- Simplified timer and performance indicators
- Made category displays more professional
- Reduced emoji usage in motivational messages while keeping the text engaging

### 2. Merged Trivia Leaderboard Systems
**Problem**: There were two separate trivia systems with independent leaderboards:
- Avatar Play System (`cogs/avatar_play_system.py`) - stored in `data/avatar_play/servers`
- Minigame Daily System (`cogs/minigame_daily.py`) - stored in `data/minigame/servers`

**Solution**: Created a unified leaderboard system that merges data from both sources:

#### New Commands:
- `/trivia_leaderboard` - Single unified command that combines data from both trivia systems
- Removed duplicate commands for cleaner command structure

#### Key Features:
- **Data Merging**: Automatically combines trivia data from both Avatar Play and Minigame systems
- **Duplicate Handling**: Merges duplicate user entries by summing their statistics
- **Scope Support**: Works for both server-specific and global leaderboards
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing commands still work but now indicate they're legacy

#### Technical Implementation:
- Added `_merge_duplicate_users()` method to handle duplicate user entries
- Modified `show_leaderboard()` to pull from both data sources
- Created single `trivia_leaderboard()` command for comprehensive leaderboards
- Removed duplicate commands to avoid confusion
